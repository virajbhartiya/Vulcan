# IRC App
## Server functionalities
  - Server acts as a MITM only for forwarding messages and not storing (kinda like a channel)
  - Messages stored on the server only till they are viewed by user(s)
  - Messages can be stored on the server only if the user wants it to (for syncing across devices and stuff. but by default - no)
  - Or we can use google account or iCloud as a backup option... like the one whatsapp uses


## App functionalities
  - Users can have custom encryption keys set for a channel
  - User(s) can have pseudo names instead of real names for anonymity

  - Messages are stored locally on a SQL database as per users' preference
  - Lock screen
  - Every user has their own digital fingerprint
